# SE Project : Sprint 2

This document contains the details of the work done in Sprint 2 of the Software Engineering Project. This sprint we focused on integrating the frontend with the backend, setting up the necessary dependencies, and writing unit tests for the frontend and backend components. The main goal was to ensure that the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.

### Backend

Backend Work Summary inlcudes completion of the following tasks,

- `Client` package
The `TimelyGatorClient` serves as the primary interface for interacting with the TimelyGator server. The following tasks were completed as part of the client implementation:
  - **GET, POST, DELETE Requests:** Added utility methods (`get`, `post`, `deleteReq`) for interacting with the server API.
  - **Bucket Management:**
    - Create, delete, and manage buckets on the server.
    - Integrated functionality to handle both queued and immediate requests.
  - **Event Handling:**
    - Implemented methods to retrieve, insert, and delete events from specific buckets.
    - Added support for retrieving event counts and exporting/importing event data.
  - **Heartbeat Functionality:**
    - Developed `Heartbeat` method to manage activity data through server heartbeats.
    - Included pre-merge and post-merge logic to optimize event data flow.
  - **Query Execution:**
    - Added `Query` method to send custom queries to the server and retrieve results.

- `AFK Observer`
The `AFKWatcher` module was developed to monitor user inactivity and send AFK status to the server through the client. The work included:
  - **Platform Validation:** Ensured that the `AFKWatcher` only runs on supported platforms (Linux).
  - **Signal Handling:** Added graceful shutdown capabilities using system signals (`os.Interrupt`, `syscall.SIGTERM`).
  - **AFK Detection Loop:**
    - Implemented the `heartbeatLoop()` to regularly check AFK status.
    - Utilized `SecondsSinceLastInput()` to detect inactivity.
  - **Heartbeat Event Creation:**
    - Created `Event` objects with status (`afk` or `not-afk`) as JSON.
    - Sent accurate heartbeat data to the server using the `client.Heartbeat()` method.

- `Chrome Browser Observer`
The Chrome Browser Extension for TimelyGator was developed to capture detailed browsing activity, including active tabs, URLs, and time spent on websites. The extension integrates seamlessly with the TimelyGator client to provide accurate and categorized tracking of web activity.
  - **URL Tracking**
     - Automatically captures the active tab's URL.
     - Sends browsing data to the TimelyGator server at regular intervals.
  - **Tab Activity Monitoring**
     - Detects when a tab is opened, closed, or switched.
     - Tracks time spent on each tab and categorizes the data.
  - **Event Communication**
     - Utilizes message passing between content scripts and the background script.
     - Establishes a secure and efficient connection with the TimelyGator client
  - **Manifest v3 Compatibility:**
    - Built using the latest Chrome extension guidelines and technologies.
    - Ensures compliance with Chrome Web Store policies.

- Swagger API Documentation
  - **API Documentation:** Generated detailed documentation for the TimelyGator API using Swagger.
    - Used the `swag` package to automatically generate API documentation.
    - Ensured that all API endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes were documented.
  - **API Testing:** Validated the API documentation by testing each endpoint using Swagger UI.
    - Verified that the API responses matched the expected formats.
    - Ensured that the API was fully functional and ready for integration with the frontend.
  - **Postman Collection:** Created a Postman collection for testing the TimelyGator API.
    - Included sample requests for each endpoint to facilitate testing and debugging.
    - Ensured that the Postman collection was up-to-date with the latest API changes.

## Unit Tests

The following unit tests were written for the frontend and backend components.

### Frontend
- Configured Cypress testing and created related `.cy` files to achieve 1:1 testing, covering:
  1. Mounting of all components.
  2. Sidebar collapsing and expanding behavior.
  3. On-hover functionality of StatCard.
  4. Line graph, bar graph, and pie chart animations.
  5. Search functionality of TabTable.
